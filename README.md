# 2020 Covid & Crime in Louisville

## Overview

### As of May 2023, the Covid-19 pandemic officially ended in the United States per the CDC. The pandemic lasted three long years and had quite the jarring effect on people spanning across the globe. Ecomonies were shaken, productivity took major hits, and online education went into hyper speed trying to adapt to the new reality that was presented. What else could have been affected by the pandemic? Could crime rates have changed? At points, we were all under "lockdown" and advised to stay home and to not go into offices to work. If there's significantly less people interacting in public, then would crime decrease as a result due to potentially decreased opporutinities? Let's try to determine if we can get answers to that question.
